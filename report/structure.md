1. Introduction
    
    - Accurate spectral measurements require knowledge of the **spectral response** — i.e., how efficiently the optical system transmits or detects light at different wavelengths.
        
    - No component is perfectly flat spectrally: filters, lenses, gratings, and detectors all distort the spectrum. This distortion must be corrected using a **known reference**.
        
    - Common calibration methods rely on:
        
        - **Calibrated light sources** (e.g., Deuterium–Halogen lamps, graphite blackbodies)
            
        - **Calibrated detectors** (e.g., Trap detectors, Predictable Quantum Efficient Detectors (PQEDs))
            
    - These are usually traceable to **primary standards** like blackbody radiation at known temperature.
        
    - However, **traditional sources degrade** with use, especially at high temperatures.  Practical limit at about 3500K with “pyrolytic-graphite” (Yoon and Gibson, 2011, p. 6), limits spectral brightness in the UV.
        
    - This project propose **thermal radiation from hot electrons**, generated by ultrafast laser excitation in solids, as a path to a **novel broadband light source** for spectral calibration.
        
        - These electrons can reach effective temperatures of several thousand Kelvin (>5000 K).
            
        - The resulting emission spans the UV–VIS region and could, in principle, serve as a stable and compact reference.
            
2. Theory
    
    Goal: Model thermal emission from hot electrons excited by ultrafast laser pulses
    
    - predicting the spectral shape and qualitative behavior of the emission
        
    - Electron temperature dynamics modeled via a simplified two-temperature model:
        
        - Assume lattice remains at constant temperature during emission period
            
        - Justified by short time scale (< few ps) and strong $T^4$ scaling of radiated power
            
    - Governing differential equation: $C_e(T_e) \frac{dT_e}{dt} = -G(T_e - T_\text{lattice}) + P(t)$
        
        - $C_e(T_e)$: electronic heat capacity (temperature-dependent)
            
        - $G$: electron–phonon coupling constant
            
        - $T_\text{lattice}$: assumed constant
            
        - $P(t)$: absorbed laser power
            
    - Spectral emission computed by integrating thermal radiation over time: $ I(\lambda) = \int \epsilon(\lambda, T_e(t)) \cdot B(\lambda, T_e(t)) \, dt $
        
        - $ \epsilon(\lambda, T)$: emissivity (assumed constant or weakly varying)
            
        - $B(\lambda, T)$: Planck function, show with note on units.  
            Assuming Lambertian emission, integration over a hemisphere introduces a factor of \( \pi \), yielding spectral exitance in W/m²/nm
            
    - Model assumptions:
        
        - No spatial variation (1D temporal model)
            
        - Constant optical properties (no transient reflectivity or emissivity changes)
            
        - Emissivity and optical penetration depth assumed independent of time and fluence

    1. Model
        
        - Table: Symbol, physical meaning, nominal value, uncertainty, and literature source
            
        - Mention the numerical integration and Monte Carlo.
            
    2. Experiment
        
        1. Focusing Procedure
            
            - Remove the sample and place a **fiber-coupled lamp** at the sample position
                
                - Use visible light to aid initial alignment
                    
            - Align the lamp beam to appear **circular and sharply focused** at the spectrometer fiber port
                
                - Ensures the optical path is approximately aligned
                    
            - Connect the **spectrometer** to its port and **maximize the signal**
                
                - Move the spectrometer slightly to find the sweet spot
                    
                - Use the micrometer screws on the sample stage for fine adjustments
                    
                - mention focused spot size
                    
            - Once optimized, **swap in the sample** at the same position
                
                - Illuminate the sample by connecting the lamp to the spectrometer port
                    
            - **Fine-focus the sample** position to minimize the visible spot size
                
                - A sharply defined spot indicates proper focus
                    
            - Turn on the **infrared laser** and use an **IR card** to locate and focus the beam on the sample
                
            - **Disconnect the lamp** and observe the **reflected laser signal** on the spectrometer
                
                - Fine-tune laser alignment and focus for maximum signal
                    
        2. Noise Sources
            
            - The noise sources are dominated by the noise of the detector.
                
            
            - Readout noise -> large bins or using camera as 1d detector
                
            - Dark current noise -> Negligible due to cooling.  
                $N_\text{dark} \propto \exp(-E / kT) \cdot t_\text{exp}$  
                Show figure on noise over temperature and exposure time
                
            - Clock-induced charge noise -> No electron multiplication gain
                
            - Shot noise and photon transfer method:
                
                - photons are converted to electrons: $N_e = \eta \cdot N_{\text{photons}}$. Then are amplified to counts $S = G \cdot N_e$.  
                    The shot noise is on the electrons, so $\sigma^2_{\text{measured}} = G^2 S$, the gain can be estimate in this way $G=10$, but the efficiency $\eta$ is still unknown.
                    
5. Results
    
    - Recorded and estimated spectrum
        
    - From this the measured normalized efficiency (with uncertainty) and the expected efficiency form the camera manufactures QE curve times a grating blaze model, with uncertain parameters.
        
    - **plot of the relative uncertainty** in the measured QE
        
6. Discussion
    
    - The comparison shows:
        
        - Good agreement in shape across most of the spectral range
            
        - Faster drop-off in measured QE on the UV side
            
    - This discrepancy is likely due to degradation of the anti-reflection (AR) coating on the camera window
        
7. Conclusion
    
    - Thermal emission from hot electrons, excited by ultrafast laser pulses, shows promise as a broadband light source for spectral calibration.
        
    - The recorded spectra exhibit qualitative stability and a smooth, continuous shape, suggesting potential as a reference.
        
    - However, the current measurements lack absolute calibration and do not cover the full spectral range of interest.
        
    - To evaluate suitability as a standard, **future measurements must be performed with calibrated reference systems and extended spectral coverage**.
        
    - Additionally, **significant engineering effort will be required** to reduce systematic uncertainties and ensure reproducibility, particularly in the modeling.
