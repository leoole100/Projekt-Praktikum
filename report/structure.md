1. Introduction 
2. Modelling of thermal Hot Electrons 
    1. ODE for T_e 
    2. Introduction to Plank's law, maybe with Einstein Coefficient derivation 
    3. model parameters 
    - Power Scaling?
    4. sensitivity analysis 
3. Experimental Setup 
    1. Measurement Setup 
    2. SNR considerations 
    3. Focusing and Alignment procedure 
    4. Data processing. (How to compare counts to calculated spectra.)
4. Measurements 
    1. Show measured spectrum, and how it deviates from the model. 
    2. Correct the spectrum using a estimated efficiency curve. 
    => Significant differences, that make a calibration using a dedicated standard necessary to prove or disprove model errors
