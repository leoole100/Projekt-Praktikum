	abstract = {In the semicontinuum model of lattice vibrations in graphite proposed by Komatsu and Nagamiya, the expressions of the dispersion relation contain the elastic constants ùê∂11, ùê∂12, ùê∂13, ùê∂33, ùê∂44, and Œ∫ and the interlayer spacing c as parameters, where ùëê‚Å¢ùúå‚Å¢ùúÖ2 is the bending elastic constant of a graphite layer and œÅ is the density. We improve this semicontinuum model by taking these parameters as a function of temperature. For the parameters except Œ∫, we use the experimental data already known and the relations derived from them. Œ∫ is determined by fitting the calculated specific heat to the experimental one. The experimental specific heat for single-crystal graphite is derived by evaluating the data reported in the literature. With the value of Œ∫ thus determined, the improved semicontinuum model can explain the experimental specific heat well in the temperature range below 350 K. Then, Œ∫ decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature than the other elastic constants; this result means that softening of the out-of-plane vibrations occurs. It is suggested that the softening is closely related to the negative thermal expansion parallel to the layer planes. The calculated Gr√ºneisen constants are compared with the experimental ones. The second derivative of the specific heat curve with respect to temperature gives information on the frequency distribution function of lattice vibrations. From the analysis of the low-temperature specific heat, the value of ùê∂44 at room temperature is determined to be 0.425 √ó1011‚Å¢d‚Å¢y‚Å¢n/c‚Å¢m2.},

	abstract = {Disorder-assisted electron-phonon scattering processes (supercollision processes) have been reported to dominate the cooling of hot carriers in graphene. Here, we determine to what extent this type of relaxation mechanism governs the hot carrier dynamics in the parent compound graphite. Electron temperature transients derived from time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectra are analyzed based on a three-temperature model which considers electron gas, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled subsystems. In the probed fluence regime of 0.035‚Äì1.4‚Å¢mJ/cm2, we find no indications for supercollision processes being involved in the cooling of the hot carriers. The data are, by contrast, compatible with a hot phonon assisted mechanism involving anharmonic coupling between optical phonons and acoustic phonons, a process which has previously been suggested for graphite. We attribute the striking difference to the reported findings for (substrate-supported) graphene to the low defect density of highly ordered pyrolitic graphite.},
