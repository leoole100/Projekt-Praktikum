1. Replace the sample with a fiber port. Attach a light to this.
2. Move the sample holder / lamp fiber such that it is in focus.\
   The beam should be circular and in focus on the spectrometer fiber port.
3. Connect a spectrometer to the focus point. Now move it around to maximize the light intensity.
   The point should be quite small $1.22 \lamba / NA = 2.44 f \lambda / D \approx 2$ um, but smaller than the $1.5$ um fiber.
4. Now replace the fiber holder with the sample, and connect the lamp to the spectrometer port.
5. To focus the sample move it to minimize the spot size it should be even smaller.
6. Now the infrared laser should be focused on the sample. For this a IR card is needed. 
7. Disconnect the lamp and optimize the reflected signal on the spectrometer, by focusing the laser spot.
