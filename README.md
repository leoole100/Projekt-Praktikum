Hot-electron thermal emission in graphite was studied as a broadband UV–VIS calibration source. Emission spectra under ultrafast excitation were compared to a two-temperature model with Planck’s law. Derived spectrometer efficiencies matched expectations apart from stronger UV roll-off, attributed to sample absorption. Sensitivity analysis identified absorption depth and cooling time as dominant uncertainties. Calibration with a traceable spectrometer is recommended to validate the models accuracy. And selection of a material with a flatter absorption curve to increase the models accuracy.
