# Andor Solis SNR maximisation
Played around with Andor Solis and a white light source.
To maximize the SNR use the lowest gain, use the conventional output (no EM gain) and use binning on the Sensor.
Signal from row 275 to 291. Multi Track (that only selects those rows) has a similar SNR than the full sensor binning.

Tried to measure efficiency of the spectrometer but failed.
Measured with 2400 lines/mm grating by accident.
