# Thinking about data storage and measurements

## Experiments

- List of `xarray.DataArray`, `xarray.Dataset`, `numpy.ndarray` and `pandas.DataFrame` objects for measurement data (CSV), and `dict` for metadata using a custom class for lazy loading.
- Using Intake catalogs.
- Making a custom catalog in the form of a lab notebook, with Python classes for `NotebookEntry`, `Measurement`, and `Experiment` that can be parsed from the YAML notebook files.\
  This can be searched by key and label, or by string search.

## Measurements
Mostly demo measurements:
- [001](001.csv)
