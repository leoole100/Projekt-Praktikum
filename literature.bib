	abstract = {In the semicontinuum model of lattice vibrations in graphite proposed by Komatsu and Nagamiya, the expressions of the dispersion relation contain the elastic constants 𝐶11, 𝐶12, 𝐶13, 𝐶33, 𝐶44, and κ and the interlayer spacing c as parameters, where 𝑐⁢𝜌⁢𝜅2 is the bending elastic constant of a graphite layer and ρ is the density. We improve this semicontinuum model by taking these parameters as a function of temperature. For the parameters except κ, we use the experimental data already known and the relations derived from them. κ is determined by fitting the calculated specific heat to the experimental one. The experimental specific heat for single-crystal graphite is derived by evaluating the data reported in the literature. With the value of κ thus determined, the improved semicontinuum model can explain the experimental specific heat well in the temperature range below 350 K. Then, κ decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature than the other elastic constants; this result means that softening of the out-of-plane vibrations occurs. It is suggested that the softening is closely related to the negative thermal expansion parallel to the layer planes. The calculated Grüneisen constants are compared with the experimental ones. The second derivative of the specific heat curve with respect to temperature gives information on the frequency distribution function of lattice vibrations. From the analysis of the low-temperature specific heat, the value of 𝐶44 at room temperature is determined to be 0.425 ×1011⁢d⁢y⁢n/c⁢m2.},

	abstract = {Disorder-assisted electron-phonon scattering processes (supercollision processes) have been reported to dominate the cooling of hot carriers in graphene. Here, we determine to what extent this type of relaxation mechanism governs the hot carrier dynamics in the parent compound graphite. Electron temperature transients derived from time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectra are analyzed based on a three-temperature model which considers electron gas, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled subsystems. In the probed fluence regime of 0.035–1.4⁢mJ/cm2, we find no indications for supercollision processes being involved in the cooling of the hot carriers. The data are, by contrast, compatible with a hot phonon assisted mechanism involving anharmonic coupling between optical phonons and acoustic phonons, a process which has previously been suggested for graphite. We attribute the striking difference to the reported findings for (substrate-supported) graphene to the low defect density of highly ordered pyrolitic graphite.},

The detector is also shown to be capable of disseminating an absolute spectral responsivity scale with an uncertainty of less than 0,02 \% at specific laser wavelengths and, independently, of realizing such a scale with an uncertainty of better than 0,05 \%.},

Light emission was found to occur across the visible spectral range (1.7–3.5 eV), with emitted photon energies exceeding that of the excitation laser (1.5 eV). The emission exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the laser fluence. In two-pulse correlation measurements, a dominant relaxation time of tens of femtoseconds is observed. A two-temperature model describing the electrons and their interaction with strongly coupled optical phonons can account for the experimental observations.},
