These changes include extending the VisSCF operational range down to 300 nm from 350 nm, thereby fully covering the ultraviolet-A (UVA) spectral region and partially covering the UVB range. These improvements have lowered the magnitudes of most of the components in the uncertainty budget and have led to combined 0.005\% transfer (k = 1) uncertainties in the spectral power responsivity calibrations over most of the spectral range. Redevelopment of the uncertainty budget results in total expanded uncertainties of spectral responsivities of less than 0.1\% (k = 2) over the spectral range from 380 nm to 980 nm, with the greatest uncertainty term coming from the calibrations of the transfer standards.},

The evaluation of material candidates for hot carrier absorbers and energy selective contacts regarding their phononic, electronic, optical and structural properties provides us with a more detailed description of a practicable hot carrier solar cell.},

Light emission was found to occur across the visible spectral range (1.7–3.5 eV), with emitted photon energies exceeding that of the excitation laser (1.5 eV). The emission exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the laser fluence. In two-pulse correlation measurements, a dominant relaxation time of tens of femtoseconds is observed. A two-temperature model describing the electrons and their interaction with strongly coupled optical phonons can account for the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {In the semicontinuum model of lattice vibrations in graphite proposed by Komatsu and Nagamiya, the expressions of the dispersion relation contain the elastic constants 𝐶11, 𝐶12, 𝐶13, 𝐶33, 𝐶44, and κ and the interlayer spacing c as parameters, where 𝑐⁢𝜌⁢𝜅2 is the bending elastic constant of a graphite layer and ρ is the density. We improve this semicontinuum model by taking these parameters as a function of temperature. For the parameters except κ, we use the experimental data already known and the relations derived from them. κ is determined by fitting the calculated specific heat to the experimental one. The experimental specific heat for single-crystal graphite is derived by evaluating the data reported in the literature. With the value of κ thus determined, the improved semicontinuum model can explain the experimental specific heat well in the temperature range below 350 K. Then, κ decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature than the other elastic constants; this result means that softening of the out-of-plane vibrations occurs. It is suggested that the softening is closely related to the negative thermal expansion parallel to the layer planes. The calculated Grüneisen constants are compared with the experimental ones. The second derivative of the specific heat curve with respect to temperature gives information on the frequency distribution function of lattice vibrations. From the analysis of the low-temperature specific heat, the value of 𝐶44 at room temperature is determined to be 0.425 ×1011⁢d⁢y⁢n/c⁢m2.},

  abstract = {Radiometry based on black bodies remains one of the fundamental fields of radiometry. Black bodies are widely used as standard sources in radiometry of noncoherent optical radiation from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared spectral regions. Outstanding progress in radiometry has been made in the last decade due to development of high-precision cryogenic radiometers, which have made it possible to decrease the measurement uncertainty to 0,01 \%. New technology and optical physics call for significant improvement in the accuracy of black-body-based radiometry and the practical realization of spectral radiance and irradiance scales having an accuracy of 0,1 \%. However, the accuracy of black-body-based radiometry is now limited by the accuracy of thermodynamic temperature measurements of a radiating cavity. For example, the uncertainty of spectral radiance and spectral irradiance scales is from 0,5 \% to 1 \% in the UV due to uncertainties in pyrometric measurements. The required uncertainty of modern black-body-based radiometry is about 0,1 \%. This can be achieved by using the latest advances in the field of high-precision radiometric instrumentation, such as absolute radiometers, large-area high-temperature black bodies and synchrotrons.},

Taking into account the wide range of the absorption coefficients of different carbon structures, an overall relatively good agreement was observed for the three methods. The ellipsometric results fit well with the ablation rate measurement, and the data obtained with photoacoustic method are also similar in the UV and NIR region; however, the values were somewhat higher in visible and nearUV range. Taking into account the limitations of the methods, they can be promising candidates for the determination of absorption coefficient when the samples are strongly scattering and there is no possibility to perform transmissivity measurements.},

Electron temperature transients derived from time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectra are analyzed based on a three-temperature model which considers electron gas, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled subsystems. In the probed fluence regime of 0.035–1.4⁢mJ/cm2, we find no indications for supercollision processes being involved in the cooling of the hot carriers. The data are, by contrast, compatible with a hot phonon assisted mechanism involving anharmonic coupling between optical phonons and acoustic phonons, a process which has previously been suggested for graphite. We attribute the striking difference to the reported findings for (substrate-supported) graphene to the low defect density of highly ordered pyrolitic graphite.},

A plasmonic metal nanostructure, which can absorb incident light in an extended spectral range and transfer the absorbed light energy to adjacent molecules or semiconductors, functions as a “plasmonic photosensitizer.” This article deals with the generation, emission, transfer, and energetics of plasmonic hot carriers. It also describes the mechanisms of hot electron transfer from the plasmonic metal to the surface adsorbates or to the adjacent semiconductors. In addition, this article highlights the applications of plasmonic hot electrons in photodetectors, photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical cells, photovoltaics, biosensors, and chemical sensors. It discusses the applications and the design principles of plasmonic materials and devices.},
